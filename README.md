I trained a YOLO model for object detection using Google Colab.

Here is the link to the notebook that I used: https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/train-yolov8-object-detection-on-custom-dataset.ipynb#scrollTo=oe9vkEvFABbN

After training the model, I installed it and used it with model_video.py
